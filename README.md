## Libraries & Technologies Used

- p5.js
- p5.js DOM

## Development Notes

- Got inspired while looking through tutorials and made this quickly
- The concept of looping frames is crucial in p5.js, but I still find it a bit tricky. Need to dive deeper.
- As a web developer, I find p5.js DOM a bit lacking, especially in state management and node selection. Also, readability could be improved.

## Future Improvements

- Considering classifying the code
- Select
- Undo/Redo
- Zoom
- Load 3D models (.obj)
- Key press events for "\[", "\[" to adjust weight
- Development ideas
  - Feature that gives random words and sets a timer for drawing
  - Analyze frequently used colors for abstract art
